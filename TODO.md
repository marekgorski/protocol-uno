## Format Reference

Every task requires acceptance criteria (AC):

```markdown
BAD:  - [ ] Write intro section
GOOD: - [ ] Write intro section
        - AC: Explains problem in <100 words
        - AC: Includes one concrete example

BAD:  - [ ] Review document
GOOD: - [ ] Review document
        - AC: All sections have headings
        - AC: No spelling errors
        - AC: Links verified working
```

**Why AC?** "Done" is ambiguous. AC makes completion verifiable.
