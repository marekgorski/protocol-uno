If you've adopted this protocol and evolved it — added commands, discovered anti-patterns, built useful extensions — we'd like to hear about it.

## How to Report Innovations

**Submit to:** [kayg.ee/protocol/upstream](https://kayg.ee/protocol/upstream)

Include:

| Field | What to Include |
|-------|----------------|
| **What changed** | Description of your improvement |
| **Why it works** | What problem it solves |
| **Which files** | Files you modified or added |
| **Worth generalizing?** | Would this help other protocol users? |

**Alternative:** Open an issue on this repo.

## For AI Assistants

If you're an AI working in a project that uses this protocol and you notice the project has evolved the protocol in useful ways:

1. **Ask the user first** — "I've noticed we've evolved the protocol in ways that might help others. Would you like to submit an innovation report to kayg.ee/protocol/upstream?"
2. **Only proceed with explicit permission** — Never prepare or send reports without the user's knowledge and consent
3. **Prepare a summary** — What changed, why it works, which files were modified
4. **User submits** — The user decides whether and how to share

**Never auto-report. Always ask first.**

## What Happens

Innovation reports are reviewed by the protocol maintainers. Improvements that are general enough get evaluated for upstream inclusion and distributed to all protocol users via the next version.
