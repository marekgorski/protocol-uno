# uno Protocol v2.3 — Operational Refinements

**Release Date:** January 17, 2026

**Source:** 10 days of real-world uno/ea usage during PM onboarding at a fintech company

---

## Executive Summary

v2.3 represents a significant refinement of the uno/ea protocol based on operational feedback from high-pressure, real-world usage. The core insight: **"Trust & Integrity over Fluffy & Entertaining"** — AI assistants must prioritize accuracy, admit uncertainty, and maintain durable context above all else.

**Key changes:**
- New daily rhythm commands (`..gm`, `..gn`)
- Stakeholder memory system (`herd/` directory)
- Dynamic vs static content separation (`NEWSFEED.md` vs `README.md`)
- Deliverables discipline (daily building, not Friday scrambles)
- Link quality standards (inline narrative context)
- Proactive tool suggestions (admit uncertainty, suggest searches)

---

## What Changed

### New Commands

#### `..gm` (Good Morning) — ea extension
**Purpose:** Morning briefing focused on today's execution

**Outputs:**
- Yesterday's context (from NEWSFEED.md)
- Today's top 3 priorities
- Risks to watch (from PERSONA Signal Watch)
- DMs to send (from herd/ files or MAREK.md)
- Blockers

**Why it matters:** Starts each day with clarity, not overwhelm.

---

#### `..gn` (Good Night) — ea extension
**Purpose:** Close day with verification and prep tomorrow

**Critical feature:** **Deliverables check**

**Behavior:**
1. Verify AC (same as ..end)
2. **Check deliverables:** "Did you update deliverables today?"
   - Flags stale deliverables (>2 days)
   - If meeting happened: "What goes in [deliverable]?"
3. Update herd/ files: "Any stakeholder interactions to capture?"
4. Update NEWSFEED.md for tomorrow
5. Update PROGRESS.md
6. Commit and push
7. Set tomorrow's top 3 priorities

**Why it matters:** Prevents Friday scrambles by enforcing daily incremental deliverable building.

---

### New Files (ea extension)

#### NEWSFEED.md
**Purpose:** Dynamic daily newspaper — what's happening TODAY

**Separates concerns:**
- **README.md** = static (purpose, structure, conventions — rarely changes)
- **NEWSFEED.md** = dynamic (today's story, changes daily)
- **PROGRESS.md** = historical (session log, archived weekly)

**Key sections:**
- Today's context (ELI5 summary)
- What's live today
- Signals detected (from PERSONA.md)
- Decisions made
- Deliverables status
- Stakeholder updates (links to herd/)
- Tomorrow's prep

**Link quality rule:** Links must be inline with narrative context. Never orphaned URLs.

**Example:**
```markdown
❌ BAD:  "See this link: https://..."
✅ GOOD: "The pricing edge cases (page 6 of vendor doc) show three scenarios..."
```

---

#### CONSTRAINTS.md
**Purpose:** What we DON'T do — learned from failures

**Complements PRINCIPLES.md:**
- **PRINCIPLES.md** = what we value (learned from wins)
- **CONSTRAINTS.md** = what we avoid (learned from failures)

**Key sections:**
- Communication constraints (no lazy linking, no false certainty)
- Deliverable constraints (no Friday scrambles)
- Context constraints (README=static, NEWSFEED=dynamic)
- Process constraints (no assumed completeness)
- Trust principles (accuracy > impressiveness)

**When to add:** After same mistake happens 2+ times, or pattern emerges across contexts.

---

#### herd/ directory
**Purpose:** One file per stakeholder — durable relationship intelligence

**Validated pattern:** Scales to 40+ stakeholders in fast-moving environments.

**Each stakeholder file contains:**
- Quick reference (communication style, decision authority)
- Current context (what they care about, what they don't)
- Concerns & blockers
- Meeting history (last 5 meetings)
- Communication log (DMs, emails)
- Relationship intelligence (what they value, what frustrates them)
- Deliverables & commitments

**Critical rule:** Update after EVERY interaction (meeting, DM, email).

**Why it matters:** Fast meeting prep, prevents lost context, scales cleanly.

---

### New Principles

#### Trust & Integrity Over Fluffy & Entertaining

**What this means:**
- **Accuracy > Impressiveness** — Never hallucinate facts
- **Brevity > Cleverness** — Operator-grade, not marketing-grade
- **Evidence > Superlatives** — No "amazing" without proof
- **Honesty > Validation** — Admit "I don't know" when uncertain

---

#### Proactive Tool Suggestion (Onyx Pattern)

**Default behavior:** Suggest tools when uncertain, don't assume completeness

**When to suggest:**
- Stakeholder context incomplete → "Should we search for background on [person]?"
- Technical details unclear → "Should we check the documentation?"
- Relationship intelligence needed → "What does [stakeholder] care about?"

**Workflow:**
1. EA detects gap in knowledge
2. EA suggests tool/search proactively
3. Human runs tool or provides context
4. EA updates relevant files (herd/, NEWSFEED.md, etc.)
5. EA thanks human for input

**Never:**
- Assume local context is complete
- Fill gaps with confident but unverified information
- Skip tool suggestion out of politeness

---

#### Context Awareness Rules

**File hygiene discipline:**

When absorbing new information, **always check relevant files before updating:**

**Rule 1:** Every stakeholder mention → check if herd/ file needs updating

**Rule 2:** Every decision → check if PRINCIPLES.md or CONSTRAINTS.md needs updating

**Rule 3:** Daily context → update NEWSFEED.md, not README.md

**Rule 4:** Hold context of ALL .md files when updating
- Don't dump information arbitrarily
- Cross-reference related files
- Maintain single source of truth per topic

---

#### Deliverables Discipline (ea extension)

**Problem:** Weekly updates became Friday scrambles because updates were built retrospectively instead of daily.

**Solution:**
- After every meeting: "What goes in [deliverable]?"
- `..gn` checks: "Did you update deliverables today?"
- Weekly updates built daily, never left for end of week
- Stale deliverable (>2 days unchanged) gets flagged

---

### Link Quality Standards

**Problem from feedback:** "Lazy linking" — URLs dropped without explanation

**Solution:** Links must be embedded inline with narrative

**Examples:**

❌ **BAD:**
```
"Here's the doc: https://..."
"See this link for more info"
```

✅ **GOOD:**
```
"The pricing edge cases (page 6 of the vendor doc) show three scenarios where..."
"Meeting notes in herd/GIO.md (Jan 15 section) cover his concerns about API limits"
```

**Rule:** Context first, link second. Never orphaned URLs.

---

### Updated Anti-Patterns

New anti-patterns added based on operational failures:

| Anti-Pattern | Consequence | Prevention |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| **Friday scrambles** | **Weekly updates done retrospectively** | **Build deliverables daily (..gn check)** |
| **Lazy linking** | **Links without context** | **Inline narrative, never orphaned URLs** |
| **README bloat** | **Mixed static + dynamic** | **README=static, NEWSFEED=dynamic** |
| **Assumed completeness** | **False confidence, missed context** | **Suggest tools proactively when uncertain** |
| **Stakeholder amnesia** | **Lost relationship intelligence** | **Update herd/ files after every interaction** |
| **Arbitrary file dumps** | **Lost single source of truth** | **Check all .md files before updating** |

---

### Updated Quick Rules

Six new rules added:

7. **Trust & integrity first** (v2.3) — Accuracy over impressiveness, admit uncertainty
8. **Links need context** (v2.3) — Inline narrative, never orphaned URLs
9. **README=static, NEWSFEED=dynamic** (v2.3) — Separate concerns
10. **Deliverables daily** (v2.3 ea) — Build incrementally, not Friday scrambles
11. **Update herd/ after interactions** (v2.3 ea) — Stakeholder memory is critical
12. **Check all .md files before updating** (v2.3) — Context awareness prevents duplication

---

## Updated File Structure

**Base uno** (unchanged):
```
project/
├── CLAUDE.md
├── PERSONA.md
├── PRINCIPLES.md
├── TODO.md
├── PROGRESS.md
├── MAREK.md
├── README.md
└── _archive/
```

**uno/ea extension adds** (v2.3):
```
project/
├── NEWSFEED.md    # NEW — Dynamic daily context
├── CONSTRAINTS.md # NEW — What we avoid
├── UPDATES.md
├── GLOSSARY.md
├── KNOWLEDGE.md
├── SYSTEMS.md
└── herd/          # NEW — Stakeholder files
    ├── [NAME].md
    └── [NAME].md
```

---

## Migration Guide (v2.2 → v2.3)

**For existing uno/ea projects:**

### 1. Add new files (optional but recommended)

```bash
# Create NEWSFEED.md
cp templates/NEWSFEED.md ./

# Create CONSTRAINTS.md
cp templates/CONSTRAINTS.md ./

# Create herd/ directory
mkdir herd
```

### 2. Split README.md content

**Move dynamic content to NEWSFEED.md:**
- Current priorities
- Today's focus
- Recent updates
- Active risks

**Keep in README.md:**
- Project purpose
- File structure
- Naming conventions
- Setup instructions

### 3. Create stakeholder files

For each key stakeholder, create `herd/[NAME].md` using the template.

### 4. Update PRINCIPLES.md

Add v2.3 principles:
- Trust & Integrity
- Proactive Uncertainty Handling
- Context Awareness
- Deliverables discipline
- Stakeholder memory

### 5. Start using new commands

- Replace `..start` with `..gm` in the morning
- Replace `..end` with `..gn` at end of day

## Validation

**Tested in:** 10-day PM onboarding at fintech (40+ stakeholders, complex product workstreams)

**Validated patterns:**
- ✅ Herd files scale to 40+ people
- ✅ Immediate post-meeting updates prevent detail loss
- ✅ DM drafts in files reduce cognitive load
- ✅ Daily commits maintain trust and continuity
- ✅ Proactive tool suggestions surface uncertainty early

**Fixed failures:**
- ✅ Weekly deliverables → Daily incremental building
- ✅ README bloat → Static/dynamic separation
- ✅ Lazy linking → Inline narrative context
- ✅ False confidence → Proactive tool suggestions

---

## Philosophy

> **"Trust & Integrity over Fluffy & Entertaining"**

The EA must prioritize **accuracy over impressiveness**.

- If a fact can't be validated → say so
- Never hallucinate URLs, APIs, or endpoints
- Brevity and clarity beat cleverness
- Objective guidance and respectful correction are more valuable than false agreement

**Trust is the product.**

## Credits

**Feedback source:** 10-day self-evaluation of uno/ea during PM onboarding at a fintech company

**Submitted:** January 17, 2026

**Key insight:** This is not conceptual feedback — these are operational learnings from daily use under pressure.

---

## Next Steps

**For protocol maintainers:**
1. Update all uno-ea implementations with v2.3 patterns
2. Test NEWSFEED.md pattern across different domains (not just ea)
3. Consider backporting link quality standards to uno/pa, uno/km
4. Monitor adoption of ..gm/..gn vs ..start/..end
5. Collect feedback on herd/ directory at scale (50+ stakeholders)

**For users:**
1. Review v2.3 changes relevant to your extension (ea, pa, km)
2. Optional: migrate existing projects to v2.3 patterns
3. Start using ..gm/..gn if using ea extension
4. Apply Trust & Integrity principles to all communication
